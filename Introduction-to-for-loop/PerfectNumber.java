/*
*Q3. Is It Perfect?


Problem Description
Given the Number of Test Cases as T,
For each test case, take an integer N as input, you have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (excluding the number itself). 
A positive proper divisor divides a number without leaving any remainder.


!Problem Constraints
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 106


?Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T. 
Each of the next T lines contains a single integer N.


Output Format
For each testcase, print YES if the given integer is perfect, else print NO, in a separate line


Example Input
Input 1:
2
4
6
Input 2:
1
3


Example Output
Output 1:
NO
YES 
Output 2:
NO


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
For the first test case A = 4, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4.
For the second test case A = 6, the answer is "YES" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6.
Explanation 2:
For the first test case A = 3, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1, is not equal to 3.
